# ideas
Startup ideas.
They are stored as Issues, so they can be sorted based on 

We are choosing to store ideas on GitHub becasue:
1. Lots of potential developers to be involved here in voting and/or discussion
2. Ideas can be 👍/👎 voted: https://github.com/binawork/ideas/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+sort%3Areactions-%2B1-desc
3. Ideas can be organized used simple tags

## TODO
[] Import old ideas from notion.so:
https://www.notion.so/skleia/dd326091e0064640b4b7bce63f437bb0?v=c24214f9c6204e2e8500ac89a7e03b42
[] Research: can we export Github issues to a website? Can Gitlab Issues be sort of forum?
